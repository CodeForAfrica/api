          # If you're not using a fine-grained remote caching service (see https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/remote-caching),
          # then you may also want to preserve the local Pants cache (lmdb_store). However this must invalidate for
          # changes to any file that can affect the build, so may not be practical in larger repos.
          # A remote cache service integrates with Pants's fine-grained invalidation and avoids these problems.
          # Note that named_caches and lmdb_store falls back to partial restore keys which
          # may give a useful partial result that will save time over completely clean state,
          # but will cause the cache entry to grow without bound over time.
          # See https://pants.readme.io/docs/using-pants-in-ci for tips on how to periodically clean it up.
